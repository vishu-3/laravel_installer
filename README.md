# laravel_installer

This functionality can be run on Linux family like ubuntu.
It works perfectly fine for Laravel version 6,7,8. Make sure that you have necessary php packages installed on your system.

I have clubbed some of commands to create installation and permission managent of laravel project a lot easier.This installer uses composer for downloading laravel project under /var/www/html directory.

you need to give this shell file excution permission for the user and can run from any directory.To give this file permission you need to run below command.


$ chmod u+x l02.sh

Then you can run it by running

$./l02.sh
