# laravel_installer

This functionality can be run on Linux family like ubuntu.

I have clubbed some of commands to create installation and permission managent of laravel project a lot easier.This installer uses composer for downloading laravel project under /var/www/html directory.

you need to give this shell file excution permission for the user and can run from any directory.To give this file permission you need to run below command.


$ chmod u+x l02.sh

Then you can run it by running

$./l02.sh
